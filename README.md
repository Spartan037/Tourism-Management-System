# Tourism-Management-System
<h2>Tourism Management System</h2>
<br>The importance of information and efficient information management is
steadily increasing due to the evolution of new technologies and highcapacity storage media but also because growing market dynamics raise
information needs. A marketing decision support system (MDSS) can be
of particular importance as it supports organizations in collecting,
storing, processing, and disseminating information, and in the decisionmaking process by providing forecasts and decision models. The recent
past showed a greater interest in recommender techniques. Nowadays
there are many travel packages existing from different websites to almost
all the places over the world. A customer finds it very difficult to search
for the best package as he/she has to browse multiple websites, contact
many travel agents and etc. which is a tedious process and is time
consuming. There should be a system where the user should have the best
package on the Internet and with a single click book the hotels, travelling
and food arrangements. To address this issue, we adopt Travel Package
System which offers the best package among all the other packages that
are on the web. This project will help tourist to by default select the best
Travel Package among all the package deals on the web. The customer
will select a travel package for a particular place based on the
recommendations provided by the previous customers who had
experience with the package.
